# E08b-Adding-Tiles

With this excercise I learned how to create tiles which had a color, a collision box, and how to replicate this easily to create many more tiles. We used a script attached to the ball node which allowed the ball to destroy the tiles. It was a little tedious and unaccurate spacing out the tiles by hand. I wonder if I can just enter in x and y cordinates for the tiles instead of dragging them around.
